# Simple Todo App

This Simple Todo App is a small project designed to serve as an introduction to React. It utilizes basic React concepts such as components, state management, and effects to create a functional todo list application. Users can add, toggle, and delete todo items, with changes persisting in local storage.

## Features

- **Add Todo**: Users can add new todo items using a simple form.
- **Toggle Todo**: Todo items can be marked as completed or uncompleted by toggling them.
- **Delete Todo**: Users can delete todo items.
- **Persistence**: Todo items are stored in local storage, ensuring that todos persist between browser sessions.

## Technologies Used

- React
- Local Storage for data persistence
- CSS for styling


## Project Structure

- `App.jsx`: The main component that holds the state and functions for todo operations.
- `NewTodoForm.jsx`: A component for adding new todo items.
- `TodoList.jsx`: A component that renders the list of todo items.
- `styles.css`: CSS file for basic styling.

## Learning Outcomes

Building this app helped me understand:

- How to use React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`) for state management and side effects.
- The importance of component-based architecture in React.
- How to pass props to child components.
- Basic CRUD operations in a React application.
- Persisting data in local storage.
